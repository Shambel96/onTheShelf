## static Website with only HTML and CSS

This is only a landing page. You can fork the project and work on it, then send me a pull request. I will review it and merge it if I find it suitable to be added.

I took the original template from an online source to improve my CSS skills by making it fully responsive and learning how to clone a design accurately.
